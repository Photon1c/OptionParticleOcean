## üöÄ Getting Started

**Live Demo:**
*(Link to your Netlify deployment will go here! Example: [https://your-option-ocean.netlify.app](https://your-option-ocean.netlify.app))*

**Running Locally:**

1.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [URL_OF_YOUR_GITHUB_REPO]
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd [YOUR_REPO_NAME]
    ```
3.  Ensure you have the necessary local JavaScript libraries (`three.js`, `OrbitControls.js`) in the `quantumoptions/js/` directory as referenced by `neon_option_ocean.html`.
4.  Open `neon_option_ocean.html` in your web browser.
    *   *Note: Some browsers might have security restrictions (CORS) when loading the `spy_quotedata.csv` or `instructions.js` directly from the file system. Running a simple local HTTP server is recommended for full functionality.*
        *   For example, using Python: `python -m http.server` (Python 3) or `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` (Python 2) in the project directory, then navigate to `http://localhost:8000/neon_option_ocean.html`.
